Welcome to my readme github profile, I'm Angel Barre, I'm currently an architecture student but I learned to program since I was a kid and now I consider myself a self taught programmer and I invite everyone to learn on their own!.
-----------
- 🤝I like to collaborate in programs of research and knowledge management.
- 📚I’m learning more about Programming and Architecture.
- 👨‍💻I’m interested in joining the community, I would like to be part of both the student and general community.
